      more gold biscuits to Farhan and the onw with less gold biscuits given 
      to Raju and the remaining box will be retained for himself.
    - This will be repeated until all boxes are completed.

You are given an array of integers as boxes[], where box[i] is the number of 
gold bisucits in the ith box. Your mission is to assist Rancho in obtaining 
the greatest number of gold biscuits possible before the treasure is shared.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: an integer N represents the number of boxes.
Line-2: N space seperated integers, the amount of gold biscuits in each box

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, maximum amount of gold he can obtain.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
6
3 5 1 2 4 7

Sample Output-1:
----------------
8

Explanation:
------------
Step-1:selection will be (7,5,2) so Srikanth takes 5.
Step-2: Selection will be (4,3,1) so srikanth takes 3.
Total = 5+3=8


Sample Input-2:
---------------
9
3 1 5 4 2 8 10 12 15

Sample Output-2:
----------------
24

Explanation:
-------------
Step-1:selection will be (15,12,2) so Srikanth takes 12.
Step-2: Selection will be (10,8,1) so srikanth takes 8.
Step-3: Selection will be (5,4,3) so srikanth takes 4.
Total = 12+8+4=24
