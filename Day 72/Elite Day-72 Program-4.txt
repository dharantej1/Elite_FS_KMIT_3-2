Anup is interested in Word Play, He invented a new game on words
Anup will give you a string S and index P (1-indexed).
You need apply the rules of the game on that string  
and find out the character at a given index P.

Rules are as follows:
1. You have to read one character at a time and keep appending as a word 
   until you find a digit(d).
2. Once you find a digit, the entire word is repeatedly appended d-1 more 
   times in total.

Input Format:
----------------
Line-1 -> A String S
Line-2 -> An integer P, index value.

Output Format:
------------------
Print the result as a String.
