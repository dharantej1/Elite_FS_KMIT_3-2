/*
There is a crowd attended for a political meeting with different groups and each
group had unique colored dresses wearing.We asked n people in the crowd that
"How many are attended from your group excluding yourself?" and collected the 
answers in an integer array answers where group[i] is the answer of the ith group.

Given the array groups, return the minimum possible attendance that could be 
there in the meeting.

Constraints:
------------
    1 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= group[i] < 1000

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n, represents the people answered.
Line-2: n space seperated integers represents the answers.

Output Format:
--------------
return an integer represents mimimum possible attendance.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
1,2,1,2,1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
7

Explanation:
------------
Out of the three groups that answered "1", there could be two groups wearing to
