Bob Khan is working with various number systems.
He has created two kinds of addressing systems to share information 
between any two electronic devices.

Addresses in Type-I has following properties:
	- This addressing has four parts, each part is called as 'octet'
	- each octet can have a decimal value between 0 to 255 only
	- each part is separated by periods(.) 
	- Leading 0's are not allowed.
	- each part should conatins atmost 3 digits.

if any octet in the 4 parts, is not satisfying the rules
specified said to be  "invalid" addressing.


Addresses in Type-II has following properties:
	- This addressing has eight parts, each part is called as 'hextet'
	- each hextext can have a hexadecimal value between 0 to ffff only
	- each part is separated by colons (:) 
	- each part should conatins atmost 4 alphanumerics, 
	  as per hexademial number system.

if any hextet in the 8 parts, is not satisfying the rules
specified said to be "Invalid" addressing.
		
You will be given an address as a string	addr.
Your task is to find, whether the given address "addr" belongs to which asddress type.
And return "Type-I" if belongs to "Type-I" Addressing, 
return "Type-II" if belongs to "Type-II" Addressing, 
return "Invalid" if not belongs to either "Type-I"  or "Type-II"Addressing.


Input Format:
-------------
A string, an address addr.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a string output, as mentioned in above statement.
