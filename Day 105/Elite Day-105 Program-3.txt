Mr Ajay Sharma is working woth words.
He found that few words in the langugage have same meaning.
Such words are given as a list of pairs as mappedpairs[],
where mappedpairs[i] = [word1, word2] indicates that word1 and word2 are 
the words with same meaning.

He is given phrase, and he wants to apply all the mappedpairs[] on the phrase.

Your task is to help Mr.Ajay Sharma to find and return all possible 
Mapped Phrases generated after applying all the mapped words,
and print them in lexicographical order.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of mapped pairs.
Next N lines: Two space separated words, mappedpair[].
Last Line: A line of words, the phrase.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of mapped phrases in sorted order.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
3
