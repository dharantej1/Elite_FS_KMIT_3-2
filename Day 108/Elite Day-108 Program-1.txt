There are N persons in a Instagram Page, the persons are identified by a 
unique identification number from 0 to N-1. There may exist a strange person 
in the IG page.

The rules to identify the strange person X are:
    - Everyone in the IG Page follows the person X.
    - X does not follow anybody in that IG Page.

You are given a N*N matrix IG[][] representing the followers in the IG Page,
the matrix contains only 0's and 1's. 0 indicates "not follows", 
1 indicates "follows". Your task is to find the strange person X among 
the N people. You are allowed to perform only one operation:
    - You can check whether M follows N, if yes, means M follows N.
    But it won't guarantee that N follows M.

You can perform this operation as less as possible to find the strange person X.

If you found a strange person X, print the identification number of X,
Otherwise, print '-1'
