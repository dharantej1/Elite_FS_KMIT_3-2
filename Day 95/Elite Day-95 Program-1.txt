Naveen manages pipe warehouse.There are n number of pipes placed vertically 
along a wall. Given l[i] is the length of the ith pipe placed on the wall from 
left to right(0-indexed). Naveen's task is to check if the pipes are in 
non-decreasing order of lengths on the wall from left to right.
If not,he can choose only 1 pipe on the wall and replace it with another pipe 
from warehouse to make it non-decreasing order.

There are all integer type of lengths are provided from warehouse.
Help Naveen whether he can can make the pipes in non-decreasing order.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer n, number of pipes on the wall.
Line-2: n space separated integers represents length of each pipe.


Output Format:
--------------
return boolean value

Sample Input-1:
---------------
5
3 4 7 6 8

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true

Explanation:
------------
Replace 7 with 5 will become non decreasing array.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
4
2 5 4 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
false

Explanation:
------------
Inorder to make it non-decreasing array we have to replace 2 elements which is not allowed.
