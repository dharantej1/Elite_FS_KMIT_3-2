A new online video game has been released, and in this video game, there are 
15-minute rounds scheduled every quarter-hour period. This means that at HH:00,
HH:15, HH:30 and HH:45, a new round starts, where HH represents an integer 
number from 00 to 23. A 24-hour clock is used, so the earliest time in the day 
is 00:00 and the latest is 23:59.

Given two strings startTime and finishTime in the format "HH:MM" representing 
the exact time you started and finished playing the game, respectively, 
calculate the number of full rounds that you played during your game session.

For example, if startTime = "05:20" and finishTime = "05:59" this means you 
played only one full round from 05:30 to 05:45. You did not play the full round 
from 05:15 to 05:30 because you started after the round began, and you did not 
play the full round from 05:45 to 06:00 because you stopped before the round 
ended. If finishTime is earlier than startTime, this means you have played 
overnight (from startTime to the midnight and from midnight to finishTime).

Return the number of full rounds that you have played if you had started 
playing at startTime and finished at finishTime.
