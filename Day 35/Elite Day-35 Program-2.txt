Venkat wants to create a unique name for his child, to do that he is referring 
two names, one is traditonal name(TN) and other is modern name(MN).

He is planning to create unique name(UN), using the following ways:
    - if traditional name TN is non empty, then add the first letter L of TN 
    to unique name UN and remove the letter L from traditional name TN
	e.g., if TN = "havi" and UN="anvika", then after adding L to UN and remove L 
	from TN, the names updated as UN="hanvika", TN="avi".
   
   - if modern name MN is non empty, then add the first letter L of MN 
    to unique name UN and remove the letter L from modern name MN
    e.g., if MN = "ram" and UN="ao", then after adding L to UN and remove L 
	from MN, the names updated as UN="rao", MN="am".
	
You are given two names, TN and MN,
