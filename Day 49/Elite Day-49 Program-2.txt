are distinct. Your task is to print "true", if and only if the number of balls
having different color codes in the bag are distinct. Otherwise, print "false".

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of balls.
Line-2: N space separated integers, the color codes of the balls.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
6
1 2 2 1 1 3

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true

Explanation:
------------
The number of balls in the bag having color code-1 are 3,
The number of balls in the bag having color code-2 are 2,
The number of balls in the bag having color code-3 are 1.
The count of balls having distinct color codes are not same.
