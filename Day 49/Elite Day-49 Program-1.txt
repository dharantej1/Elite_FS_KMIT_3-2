There is a switch-board made by an electrician,
If you turn on any two adjacent switches, it will cause short-circuit
and damage the switch-board.

You are given N integers(only 0's and 1's), Indiactes current status of the 
switch board with N switches, where 1 indiactes switch is ON and 0 indiactes 
switch is OFF. And an integer K, more number of switches to be turned ON.

Return true if and only if you can turn ON all the K switches, without causing 
any damage to switch-board. Otherwise return fasle.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers N and K, number of switches, and more K switches to be ON
Line-2: N space separated integers, only 0's and 1's.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value.
