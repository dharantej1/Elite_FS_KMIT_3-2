Bablu is playing a eating challenge game.
The game contains 3 boxes, each box contains P,Q and R number of laddus.

To score in the game the rules are as follows:
	- You can select any two non-empty boxes, 
	and eat one laddu from each box, you will get 1 point.
	- Repeat the above step, until you can find two non-empty boxes.
	Otherwise game will end.
	
Your task is to help Bablu to score maximum points in the game.

Input Format:
-------------
Three space separated integers, P, Q, R.

Output Format:

Print an integer, maximum points Bablu can score in the game.


Sample Input-1:

5

Explanation:
------------
The game starts with boxes with [3, 3, 4] laddus. 
One optimal solution to score max points is:
- Eat from 1st and 2nd boxes, remaining is [2, 2, 4]
- Eat from 1st and 3rd boxes, remaining is [1, 2, 3]
- Eat from 1st and 3rd boxes, remaining is [0, 2, 2]
- Eat from 2nd and 3rd boxes, remaining is [0, 1, 1]
- Eat from 2nd and 3rd boxes, remaining is [0, 0, 0]
You can't select two non-empty boxes, so the game ends.
