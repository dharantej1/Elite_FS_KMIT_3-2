At a night club there is a game organizing to gain maximum gold. 
Weekend Venat Rao is ready to play the game with an initial amount of X, 
initial gold is 0, and a set of coupons where coupon[i] is the amount 
in the ith coupon(0-indexed).

Weekend Venkat Rao's goal is to achieve highest gold.
He can play each coupon in one of two ways as per rules:
	- If the amount with Venkat Rao is at least the amount in coupon[i], 
	then he may play the ith coupon as head, losing coupon[i] amount 
	and gaining 1 gold.
	- If Venkat Rao's gold count is at least 1, he may play the i-th coupon 
	as tail, gaining coupon[i] amount and losing 1 gold.

Each coupon may be played at most once and in any order. 
There is no need to play all the coupons by Weekend Venkat Rao.
