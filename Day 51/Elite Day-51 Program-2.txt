Chitti Naidu is a school kid, writing a series of numbers in a special way.

The series is looks like following: 
	- For example, starting number is 25
	- Next number in the series is, count of digit groups like "one 2 and one 5', written as 1215.
	- Next number in the series is, count of digit groups like "one 1, one 2, one 1 and one 5', 
	written as 11121115 and so on.

You will be given a string S (A number), an integer N, where S is the starting number of series, 
You need to find the N-th term in the series. 

Note: Each term of the series of integers will be represented as a string.

Input Format:
-------------
A String S and an integer N

Output Format:
--------------
Print the N-th term in the series starts with S.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
25 3

Sample Output-1:
----------------
11121115


Sample Input-2:
---------------
21 4

Sample Output-2:
----------------
132112

Explanation:
---------------
1st term, S = 12
2nd term is "one 2 one 1" -> "1211",
3rd term is "one 1, one 2, two 1's " -> "111221"
Finally 4th term is  "three one's, two 2's, one 1" -> "312211".
