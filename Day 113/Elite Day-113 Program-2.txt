There are N constructions in pyramid structures, you are given the N pyramids 
information as an array pyramids[], where pyramid[i]={center_of_base, peak} of 
the pyramid. A pyramid is described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, 
with its center of the base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak. 
More formally, the gradients of ascending and descending the pyramid are 1 
and -1 respectively.

A pyramid is considered visible if its peak does not lie within another pyramid 
(including the border of other pyramids).

Your task is to return the number of visible pyramids.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of pyramids
Next N lines: Two space separated integers, center_of_base and peak.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer result.
