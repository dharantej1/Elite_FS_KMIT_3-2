VishnuVardan is working with Binary Trees.
Kishore is planned to flip the binary tree horizontally.

The rules to flip the binary tree are as follows:
	- The original root node becomes the new right node.
	- The original left node becomes the new root node.
	- The original right node becomes the new left node.

Your task is to help VishnuVardan to flip the tree horizontally with 
given rule set.

Your task is to implement the class Solution:
	- public BinaryTreeNode horizontalFlippedTree(BinaryTreeNode root)
	return the new root node.

NOTE:
- The mentioned rules are applied level by level, it is guaranteed that 
  every node in the given tree has either 0 or 2 children.
- Every right node in the tree has a left node sharing the same parent
- Every right node in the tree has no children


Input Format:
-------------
Space separated integers, nodes of the tree.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of nodes of flipped tree as described below.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 2 3 5 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
5 1 2 3 4


Sample Input-2:
---------------
4 2 5

Sample Output-2:
----------------
2 5 4
