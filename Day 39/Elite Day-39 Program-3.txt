Your task is to help Mr Mohan to find the number of ways to decorate the wall,  
the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer as outpur, number of ways to decorate.

        color3 = (2*color3 + 2*color2)
        color2 = (2*temp + 3*color2)
    return (color3 + color2) % mod
