Skandhanshi Infra Township constructed N Villas in a row.
They planned to paint the villas with three colors, 
snow-white, sky-blue and light-green. 
And adjacent villas should not paint with same color.

You are given the cost of painting each villa with these colors, cost[N][3].
cost[i][0] is cost of painting with snow-white.
cost[i][1] is cost of painting with sky-blue.
cost[i][2] is cost of painting with light-green.
where, 0 <= i < N.

Your task is to find the minimum cost to paint all the villas.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of villas.
Next N lines: 3 space separated integers, cost to paint the villas.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, minimum cost to paint all the villas.


Sample Input:
---------------
3
17 2 17
16 4 5
14 3 19

Sample Output:
----------------
10

Explanation: 
------------
1st Villa painted with sky-blue, 2nd Villa painted with light-green,
3rd Villa painted with sky-blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

def minCost(villas):
    dp = [0] * 3
    for a, b, c in villas:
        c1 = min(dp[1], dp[2]) + a
        c2 = min(dp[0], dp[2]) + b
        c3 = min(dp[0], dp[1]) + c
        dp = [c1, c2, c3]
        # print(c1,c2,c3,dp)
    return min(dp)
    
n=int(input())
villas=list(list(map(int,input().split()))[:3] for _ in range(n))
print(minCost(villas))
