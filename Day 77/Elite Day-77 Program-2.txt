Mr Nagireddy working with statements.
Each statement consists of only lowercase alphabets and whitespaces, 
and each statement neither starts nor ends with a whitespace
and each word in the statement separated by a single whitespace only.

Mr Nagireddy's task is to perform the join operation on these statements:
The joining operations is performed as follows:
	- If the last word of a statement-1 and first word of statement-2 are same,
	then you can join the statements-1 & statement-2 and 
	the joining word will appears once in the result statement.
	- It is not allowed to join the statements with itself.
Note that the order of joining the statements matters.

You will be given N statements.
Your task is to help Mr Nagireddy to join the statements, and 
return them as a list of distinct statements in lexicographic order.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of statements.
Next N lines: Single line String, the statement with one or more words.

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of strings, the joined statements.


Sample Input-1:
