    - He can jump from current level 'L' to 'L*2' level, by losing 1 diamond.  

The game has N levels an Sharath is given D diamonds.
Find the least number of steps required to finish the game by Sharath.
And print the number of steps.

Input Format:
-------------
Two space separated integers, N and D

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer result.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
7 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Explanation: 
------------
Sharath is at level-1, 
Step-1: He can complete level-1 and move to level-2
Step-2: He can complete level-2 and move to level-3
Step-3: He can use the diamond and jump to level-(3*2) => level-6
Step-4: He can complete level-6 and move to level-7, He wins the game.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
23 3

Sample Output-2:
----------------
7
