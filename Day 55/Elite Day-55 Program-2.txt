Ms.Akhila is a famous mathematician in a school, one day she decided to
send her students to Maths Olympiad competetion

To do that MS, Akhila called N number of students and ask them to stand in line.
Each student is having distinct grade according to his/her perfomences based
on the exams she conducted so far.

In order to send the students to Olympiad, Ms. Akhila has to form a team of 
3 students among N students from the line with following conditions:
	-> Pick any 3 students with index(p,q,r) with 
	grade(grade[p],grade[q],grade[r]).
	->A team is consider as valid if: 
	  - ( grade[p] < grade[q] < grade[r] ) or ( grade[p] > grade[q] > grade[r] )
 	    where (0 <= p < q < r < N).                                           
     
You are given grades[], grades of N students in the line.                                    
Your task is to return the number of teams Ms.Akhila can form with 
given conditions (students can be part of multiple teams).

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: AN integer N, number of students.
Line-2: N space seperated integers, grades[].

Output Format:
--------------
