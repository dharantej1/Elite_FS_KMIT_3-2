There is a large table, and a shooter kept N watermelons on it.
Each watermelon is kept one after the other in the given X-axis positions.
The length of the watermelons may vary.

The shooter has a raffle gun, and it can blast any number of watermelons 
into pieces with single shot in a straight line. After each gun shot, 
you can remove the blasted watermelons 

You will be given the positions of the watermelons on the large table melons[].
where melon[i] = [Xi, Xj], indicates the melon kept in the table between 
Xi and Xj and watermelon length is Xj-Xi, and Xi<Xj.

Your task is to find the minimum number of gun shots, 
required to blast all the watermelons into pieces.
