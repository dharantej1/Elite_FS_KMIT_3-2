There are N cities in a state.
The cities are connected with two types of roadways:
1) concrete roadway 2) asphalt roadway.
The roadways may be parallel.

You are given the lists of concrete roadways and asphalt roadways
between the cities. All roadways are unidirectional.
Concrete_Roadway[i,j] indiactes: a concrete road from city-i to city-j. Similarly,
Asphalt[i,j] indiactes: an asphalt road from city-i to city-j. Similarly,

Your task is to find and return the list of lengths of the shortest paths from 
city-0 to city-P, where P start from 0 to N-1. And the path should contains 
alternative roadways like as follows: concrete - asphalt - concrete -asphalt --etc
or vice versa. If there is no such shortest path exist print -1.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: 3 space separated integers N, C & A, Number of cities, routes between the cities.
		number of concrete roads and number of asphalt roads
Next C lines: Two space separated integers, concrete road between city-i to city-j.		
Next A lines: Two space separated integers, asphalt road between city-i to city-j.		

Output Format:
--------------
Print the list of lengths, the shortest paths.
