Vihaan is given a list of words[]. 
He is asked to create a method which returns the numbers of characters in a word 
formed from long lasting frequent posteriority.

Posteriority is the word formed from the original word with few characters removed
without modifying the corresponding order of the left over characters.

An uncommon posteriority between the list of words is a word that is a posteriority
of one word but not the others.

Your task is to find the longest uncommon posteriority of the list of words.
Return 0 if no uncommon posteriority.
