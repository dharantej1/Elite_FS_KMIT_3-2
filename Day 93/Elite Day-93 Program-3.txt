A graduate at University of California (UoC) has to follow certain rules.

UoC offering K subjects, the subjects are indexed from 0 to K-1.
Some subjets have to follow the conditions, like condition[i]= [Xi, Yi], 
which specifies you must take the subject Yi before the subject Xi.

You are given total number of subjects and a list of the condition pairs.
Return the ordering of subjects that a graduate should take to finish all subjects.
	- the result set should follow the given order of conditions.
	- If it is impossible to complete all subjects, return an empty set.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer K, number of subjects.
Line-2: An integer C, number of conditions.
Next C lines: Two space separated integers, Xi and Yi.

Output Format:
--------------
Return a list of integers, the ordering of subjects that a graduate should take 
to finish all subjects


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4
3
1 2
3 0
0 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[2, 1, 0, 3]

Explanation-1:
--------------
There are a total of 4 courses to take. 
Subject 1  should be taken after you finished subject 2.
Subject 3  should be taken after you finished subject 0.
Subject 0  should be taken after you finished subject 1.
So the correct subject order is [2, 1, 0, 3].

Sample Input-2:
---------------
5
5
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 0

Sample Output-2:
----------------
[]

Explanation-2:
-------------
No subject can be completed because they depend on each other.
