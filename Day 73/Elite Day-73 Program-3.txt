Vimal and Kamal are pals. They're attempting to play a word game.
The following are the game's rules:
- There will be two terms in the game: w1 and w2.
- One of the words must be chosen by Kamal.
- If Kamal picks w1, w1[i] should be greater than w2[i], for every 'i' 
  in 0 <= i < w1.length OR vice versa, for some shuffle of w1 and w2.
- Kamal is the winner if the preceding step is true; else, Kamal is the loser.

Your task is to assist Kamal in selecting the winning word.
If feasible, print 'winner,' if not, 'loser.'
