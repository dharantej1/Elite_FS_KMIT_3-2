In recent times, lot of people are effecting with Covid, the need of oxygen
cylinders is high. There is a need, of K oxygen cylinders. The need of oxygen 
by the coivd patient may vary from patient to patient.

There are 'N' number of patients with the given need of oxygen as need[], 
where 'i'th patient need is need[i].
and each Oxygen cylinder can handle maximum need 'S'. 
Each cylinder can serve at most two covid patients at same time, the sum
of needs of those patients should be <= 'S'.

Find out the minimum number of cylinders 'K' required to serve all 
the covid effected patients.

Note: It is guaranteed that an oxygen cylinder can serve one covid patient
of any amount of need of oxygen.
